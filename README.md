## Why I built this...on my phone...in bed

I was in bed, about to go to sleep, scrolling through Twitter and I saw a code challenge ... something like "change an array of numbers/nulls into smaller arrays split on the nulls". I was intrigued.

I wanted to try it on an actual JS playground and tried a few: codesandbox, replit require auth, the rest suck on mobile (can't select properly and they just suck).

So I thought: I'll make one.

Remember: I'm in bed, on my phone, and my whole reason for wanting this was to not get out of bed.

So I went to the ChatGPT app.

I long-pressed and copied the HTML code and then opened GitHub in Safari. I created a new repo (this one) and created an index.html and pasted the code in there.

I then went to Cloudflare on my phone and created a new Cloudflare Pages instance, and connected it to the Github repo to deploy.

I then added a custom subdomain (js.jamon.dev) and deployed.

And it worked!

I then proceeded to spend the next hour tweaking it via ChatGPT / copy / paste to Github.

I added:

* Persistence to LocalStorage as you type
* Multiple saved sessions
* Delete session
* Customized title
* Copy as URL for sharing sessions
* Error handling
* Lots of little tweaks

I never did get to the code challenge. ðŸ˜‚

MIT, enjoy ... but believe me, you could make this yourself in an evening, on your phone.
